    "        - dd: data download\n",
    "        - dp: data preprocessing \n",
    "        - ds: data science, building models and performing analytics\n",
    "    - List of data sources:\n",
    "        - bbs, dgfp, dhis2, dhs, unicef, combined (if data is combined from multiple sources)\n",
    "    - Meta information or number:\n",
    "        - Extra information that can be of value and easy to refer to\n",
    "        - If number is used it is essential to provide a detailed explanation in the script. If not in the script than there must be an .md or .txt file with the same name as script that describes the following things:\n",
    "            - What is the input and where is stored (a relative path within repository)\n",
    "            - Short description of what script or notebook is doing\n",
    "            - Whati is the output and where is stored. It is prefered for script to have one output file or directory only if possible and named the output by the script name. \n",
    "    - Example 1: **dd_dhis2_demo.ipynb**: This is a demo Jupyter notebook is used to download dhis2 data.\n",
    "    - Example 2: **dp_unicef_mics.R**: This is R script used for data preprcoessing of MICS UNICEF data.\n",
    "    - Exmaple 3: **ds_combined\\_dbscan.R**: This is an R script that performs analysis on the combined dataset (specify in the script or accompanied .md or .txt file which explains what data is combined) document "
