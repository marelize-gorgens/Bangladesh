Notes on Recode File


Women Data File

1.  In Bangladesh, the Bengali calendar is commonly used for dating purposes.
The calendar has a different year and month system to the English calendar.  The
length of the Bengali year corresponds roughly to that of a year in the English
system, each having 12 months.  Each Bengali month begins about mid-way through
the corresponding English month, and the new year in the Bengali system begins
in mid- April.  The correspondence between the two systems can be seen by
referring to the calendar section of the questionnaire, in the Bangladesh main
country report.

The BDHS questionnaire was designed so that responses could be recorded using
either the Bengali or English calendar system, although there was a requirement
that the same system had to be used throughout an individual questionnaire.  To
allow both types of date to be recorded, a four-digit field was used to record
years, and an extra question was included for all date questions to indicate the
type of calendar system being used.

During imputation and the creation of the recoded data file, all dates were
converted into English calendar dates, with the exception of the two
country-specific variables, S229 and S233D.  The type of calendar used in the
questionnaire is recorded in variable SDFORMAT.  Therefore, when working with
the recoded data set, there is no need for the analyst to convert between
calendar systems.

In cases where the Bengali calendar system was being used in an interview, and
the interview was carried out in the first half of the English calendar month,
one month was subtracted from the date of interview, as expressed in the English
calendar, for the purposes of date checking and imputation.  This was done to
allow the calendar to begin in the correct Bengali month for the date of
interview, and to enable consistency to be maintained between the calendar dates
and the dates given in the body of the questionnaire.

Note that the standard variables for date of interview for both female and male
recode files (V006,V007,V008, MV006,MV007,MV008) are based on the adjusted value
for the date of interview, in those cases where the adjustment was made.  Ages
and imputed dates were also based on the adjusted date.  Country specific
variables SINTM and SINTY are used to record the original month of interview
(MSINTM and MSINTY for husbands).  The variable SADJUST/MSADJUST records whether
or not the adjustment was made.  The unadjusted CMC date of interview can be
calculated as follows :

          <women unadjusted cmc date of interview>     = V008 - SADJUST
          <husbands unadjusted cmc date of interview> =  MV008 - MSADJUST

2.  HV105, Age of household members.  Code þ97' includes those aged 96 years or
older.

3.  HV116, Marital status of household members.  Respondents were only asked if
they had ever been married or not.

4.  HV204, V115.  Time to get to water source and return.  In Bangladesh, the
respondents were asked two separate questions; the length of time taken to get
to the water source, and the length of time taken waiting to obtain water.  The
total time taken to get to the source, obtain water, and return was calculated
by doubling the time taken to get to the source, and adding the waiting time,
ie.

total access time = (time to source * 2) + waiting time.

If either time to source, or waiting time, is missing, the total access time is
set to missing.

Note that the time to source is based on the source of non- drinking water,
rather that of drinking water as is standard in most DHS countries.

5.  HV205, V116.  Type of toilet facility.  For Bangladesh, separate questions
were asked about the toilet facilities used by adults, and toilet facilities
used by children.  The recode variables are based on type of facilities used by
adults.  The type of toilet facility used by children is recorded in country
specific variables SH25 (household, RECH3) and SQ123 (individual, REC91).  Note
that where no children use the toilet facility, SH25 and SQ123 are coded as þ0 :
No childrenþ.

6.  V013.  Age in 5-year groups.  Since the sample is ever- married women aged
between 10-49, this variable contains an extra category for respondents aged
10-14 years.

7.  B9.  Person child lives with.  In Bangladesh, this question was asked for
all living children, irrespective of age.  In the standard DHS questionnaire, it
is only asked for children less than 15 years of age.

8.  V379.  Source known for any method.  The category þFamily Welfare Assistantþ
(FWA) cannot be classified as either public or private, since FWAþs work for
both government and non-government organizations.  Because of the difficulty of
getting respondents to correctly identify whether their FWA was government or
NGO employed, no attempt was made in the survey to distinguish between the two.
Consequently, FWAþs are coded as a separate, non-standard category þ41' in V379,
and as code þ7 :  otherþ in V380.

9.  V393.  Visited by a Family planning worker in the last 12 months.  This
variable has an extra, non-standard category þ8 :  Donþt knowþ.

10.  V366A.  Acceptability of radio messages on Family Planning.  In the
questionnaire, respondents were asked whether they approved of messages
separately by type of method.  A respondent is considered to approve of messages
about family planning in general, if she approves of messages about any one
method, even if she disapproves of messages about another method.

11.  V375A, V376.  Main reason for not using a contraceptive method.  In
Bangladesh, women who were not married at the time of interview were not asked
questions about the reason why they were not using a method, or why they did not
intend to use a method in the future.  For this reason, these variables are
coded þ11 - not marriedþ for women who were not currently married at the time of
interview.

For both variables, there is an extra category þ35 :  Fatalisticþ.

12.  V416.  Heard of Oral Rehydration.  Respondents were only asked if they had
used ORS, not if they had heard of ORS.  Therefore, code þ2 :  heard of ORSþ is
not used in V416.

13.  V501, V502.  Marital Status.  Since the Bangladesh survey was based on an
ever-married sample, there are no codes þ0' (never married) for V501 and V502.
In the questionnaire, the consensual union category was not used, so the only
possible responses were:-

- currently married
- widowed
- divorced

14.  V603, V616 Preferred waiting time until next birth, and preferred time for
future birth .  Since the survey was based on an ever-married sample, the
category 'after marriage' was not used.

15.  V704/Q705.  Husbandþs occupation.  The country specific occupation
categories did not include clerical or sales categories.

16.  Respondentþs work status.  All work status variables for the respondent are
based on currently working women only.  This differs from the standard base for
these variables, which includes information about both currently working women,
and women who had been working in the 12 months prior to the interview.  The
variables affected are :-

V716      Respondent's occupation
V717      Respondent's occupation (recoded to standard categories)
V723      Child minder
V732      Employment all year/seasonal
V740      Type of land where the respondent works

17.       V716/Q709 Respondentþs occupation

These codes were recoded to make them compatible with the codes used for the
husbands/men's occupation as follows

Female codes                  Male codes
Agriculture              ->   Agricultural worker (no female farmers/landowners)
Business                 ->   Small business (no female 'big businessmen')
Poultry raising, etc     ->   Small business (not agriculture)

The original occupation codes for women are preserved in country specific
variable S709.

18.  V723.  Person responsible for childminding.  The base for this variable is
women who had a live birth after April 1988.  The standard base is women who had
live births in the 5 years preceding the date of interview.

19.  M37A-T.  Types of food given to child in the last 24 hours.  In DHSIII
questionnaires, this information is normally obtained for all children born in
the last 3/5 years.  However, for Bangladesh, these questions were only asked
for the youngest living child (ie the last surviving birth).

20.  V229, V230, V231, V232.  Date of most recent termination of pregnancy.  In
Bangladesh, dates for termination could be reported in two places in the
questionnaire :

1. Date of last termination, not induced      (Q229)
2. Date of last induced abortion.             (Q233D)

In cases where the respondent gave an answer to both questions, it is necessary
to determine which of the two dates was the most recent, in order to obtain the
most recent date of termination for use with V229-V232.  The following rules
were used to calculate V229-V232.  If there was only one response given out of
Q229 and Q223D, that response was used to create V229-V232.

If two responses were given , the most recent one was used if both responses
contained completely specified dates, with month and year both given.  Otherwise
if one date was not completely specified, but the other date was, the complete
date was used.  If neither date was completely specified, the following order of
preference was used :-

   a) DK (98)
   b) Inconsistent (97)
   c) MISSING (99)

The date obtained using the above process was then compared with the most recent
date of termination in the calendar.  Where there is an inconsistency, the
calendar date is used in the following circumstances :

1.  If the date obtained from the questionnaire was not completely specified (ie
month or year was missing)

2.  If there was a termination or induced abortion in the calendar for which a
complete date does not exist, and the date in the calendar is different to the
date obtained from the questionnaire, and the calendar date is more recent.

Both original dates for termination have been kept as country specific variables
S229 and S233D.

21.  V739.  Person who decides how to spend household money.  In the
questionnaire, only 3 categories were used:  þrespondentþ, þsomeone elseþ, and
þjointlyþ.  These were coded to the standard categories as follows :-

respondent     ->   respondent
someone else   ->   someone else (but includes partner)
jointly        ->   jointly with someone else (including partner).

22.  Q319B.  Reason why no recent injection.  This question was included in the
questionnaire, but was dropped from the standard recode data file since only 15
respondents were asked the question, and of those only three gave valid
responses.  The unweighted frequency distribution for this question was :

Health reasons                 2
Other                          1
Missing                       12
NA                          9625

Husband  Data File

1.  MV006, MV007, MV008.  Date of interview.  See note 1.  for the womenþs data.

2.  MV013.  Age in 5 year groups.  All husbands over the age of 15 were
interviewed, and there was no upper age limit.  All respondents aged 60 years or
over are grouped in the same category þ10 - 60+þ.

3.  All respondents were asked their current occupation, without first being
asked whether they were currently working.  Those who responded that they were
unemployed or retired were coded as not currently working for the standard
recode variables MV714, MV716 and MV717.

Inconsistencies in the Data File : Women

1.  In the household file, there are 63 cases where the variable indicating that
the sources of drinking and washing water are the same, is inconsistent with the
responses given for each source.  There are 91 corresponding cases in the
womanþs file.  The variables concerned are:-

Household           Woman
HV201               V113           Source of drinking water
HV202               V114           Source of non-drinking water
HV203               V142           Same source of water.

2.  There are 23 cases where the duration of amenorrhea exceeds the interval
between two births, or the interval between the last birth and a pregnancy or
the date of interview.

3.  There are 45 cases where the duration of amenorrhea together with the
reported time since last period, exceeds the interval between the date of
interview and the last birth.  4.  There are 21 cases where ever-use of male
sterilization is reported, but the method is not being currently used.

5.  There are 17 cases where the duration of abstinence exceeds the interval

inconsistent with the time given for the end of the interview.

9.  There are 28 cases where the age at death of a child in variable B6 was
reported in days, where the number of days exceeds 31.  In these cases, the
imputed age at death given in months in variable B7 is set to 1 month.

10.  There are 9 cases where the woman is sterilized, but later gives birth.
These cases are assumed to be cases of sterilization failure.

11.  There are five cases where the date of sterilization in the calendar does
not match the duration of use of sterilization stated in V337.

12.  There are two cases of women who stated that they have never had a period,
but have given birth.

13.  There are three cases of women who stated that their last period was before
their last birth, but who have not reported any births.

14.  There are five cases of women who reported being married before the
beginning of the calendar, but who are not recorded as being married in the
calendar.

15.  There are 4 cases where the first line of the household schedule is not
that of the head of the household.

Inconsistencies in the Data File : Husbands
