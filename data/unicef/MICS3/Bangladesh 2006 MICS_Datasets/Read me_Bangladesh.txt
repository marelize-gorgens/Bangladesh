In this compressed WINZIP folder you will find the MICS3 datasets for the selected 
country. 

Four SPSS data files were produced, corresponding to the four main units of analysis: 
Households -  hh.sav 
Household members - hl.sav
Women in reproductive age (15-49 years of age) – wm.sav
Mothers or primary caretakers of children under the age of five. – ch.sav

The characteristics of the data such as year of the survey, sample sizes, weights, 
dictionary of variables, variable labels, codes and information on recoded or imputed 
variables can be found within the survey archive which is available on 
http://www.childinfo.org/mics3_surveys.html. The survey archive also contains the 
questionnaires and information on the sampling and implementation of the survey.  

Notes on the Bangladesh datasets: 

1.	In the Bangladesh MICS 2006 the standard MICS recommended salt test kit was 
not used. An iodine testing solution was used to test household salt for iodine and 
potassium iodate content using an iodine testing solution. The iodine testing 
solution is a quantitative test and cannot detect whether the salt is adequately 
iodized or not. 

Access Conditions: 

Survey datasets are distributed at no cost for legitimate research, with the condition that
