Attached is the file containing 78 tables of Child-wellbeing survey. Few points to note before you use it.
1. You will find differences in table serial numbers from  7.1 onwards in the final report. It is because, we have merged tables of chapter 8 with 7 and then changed tables of 9 to 8;
2. Data values in the tables with less than 50 and 25 unweighted cases are in parenthesis or marked * in the final report but not in the excel tables;
3. There are data rows deleted due to very low response, mainly for some religious groups.
